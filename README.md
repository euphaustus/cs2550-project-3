This is a project for my cs2550 class. it has been a lot of work, as 
web development is new to me, but it has been a very fun project to build.
The hardest part was creating something with aesthetic quality. That is
difficult for me, as is evident in my work, but I feel like I've done
the best I could with the knowledge I've gained so far.
